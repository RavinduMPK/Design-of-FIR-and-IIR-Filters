# Design of FIR and IIR Filters

This project involves the design of FIR and IIR digital filters to meet specified requirements using various methods. The main objectives are to design, analyze, and compare the performance of these filters.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following tasks:
1. Design an FIR bandpass digital filter using the windowing method and the Kaiser window.
   a) Plot the impulse response.
   b) Plot the magnitude response in the frequency domain.
   c) Plot the magnitude response for the passband region.

2. Design an IIR bandpass digital filter using the bilinear transformation method.
   a) Select an approximation method based on your index number.
   b) Tabulate the coefficients of the transfer function.
   c) Plot the magnitude response in the frequency domain.
   d) Plot the magnitude response for the passband region.

3. Compare the computational complexity (order, number of multiplications, and additions) of the designed FIR and IIR filters.
